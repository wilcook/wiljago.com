# Personal website with color changing snake plants

This site was built using React.Js and Gatsby. To view the live site, please look at  [wiljago.netlify.com](https://wiljago.netlify.com/).

The snake plant SVGs are saved as JavaScript files, and can be found in /src/components/SVGs. The color randomizing is simple and placed directly within /src/pages/index.js.

This site is a work in progress. Currently I'm using it to figure out programmatic external linking in React. The next phase will be to add CSS animations and a more fun 404 page.
